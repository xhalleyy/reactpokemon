### React Pokemon API
- Search for a Pokemon from Gen1-5 by Name or by their ID. Click the Image to change between the pokemon's default and shiny.
- Console Errors/Warnings due to Flowbite's Accordion. Tried to change prop names from the shadow dom but it threw the same errors.

Description: Started on layout and the navbar component. After the buttons were there, I worked on the body component, containing all the info with the accordions. I then did interfaces and fetched the data. Afterwards, I created Hooks and used Context to pass information through each component.
